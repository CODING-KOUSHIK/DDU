13. : What will be the output of the following program? x = [0, 1, [2]] x[2][0] = 3 print x x[2].append(4) print x x[2] = 2 print x
14. Python has a built-in function sum to find sum of all elements of a list. Provide an implementation for sum
15. What happens when the above sum function is called with a list of strings? Can you make your sum function work for a list of strings as well?
16. Implement a function product, to compute product of a list of numbers
17. Write a function reverse to reverse a list. Can you do this without using list slicing?
18. Cumulative sum of a list [a, b, c, ...] is defined as [a, a+b, a+b+c, ...]. Write a function cumulative_sum to compute cumulative sum of a list. Does your implementation work for a list of strings?
19. Write a function cumulative_product to compute cumulative product of a list of numbers.
20. Write a function unique to find all the unique elements of a list.
21. Write a function dups to find all duplicates in the list
22. Write a function group(list, size) that take a list and splits into smaller lists of given size.
23. Write a function lensort to sort a list of strings based on length.
24. Improve the unique function written in previous problems to take an optional key function as argument and use the return value of the key function to check for uniqueness.
25. Reimplement the unique function implemented in the earlier examples using sets.
