Certainly! If you have a list of words and you want to obtain their phonetic representations, you can modify the example code as follows:

```python
from phonetics import soundex, metaphone

# Example word list
word_list = ["debut", "debate", "python", "example"]

# Phonetics representations using Soundex and Metaphone
soundex_list = [soundex(word) for word in word_list]
metaphone_list = [metaphone(word) for word in word_list]

# Displaying the results
for i, word in enumerate(word_list):
    print(f"Word: {word}\nSoundex: {soundex_list[i]}\nMetaphone: {metaphone_list[i]}\n")
```

Replace the `word_list` with your own list of words, and this script will generate phonetic representations using both Soundex and Metaphone for each word in the list.
