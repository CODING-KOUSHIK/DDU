1. You have the cost price and selling price of a product. Write a function to calculate the profit.
2. Write a function to get unique elements from a list.
3. Python program to remove spaces from string without inbuilt function.
4. What is the difference between a mutable data type and an immutable data type?
5. How can you replace string space with a given character in Python?
6. Given a positive integer num, write a function that returns True if num is a perfect square else False.
7. Write a Python function that classifies a given number into different categories based on the following conditions:
 
If the number is even, print "Even".
If the number is odd and greater than 10, print "Odd and Greater than 10".
If the number is odd and less than or equal to 10, print "Odd and Less than or Equal to 10".
8. Design a Python function calculate_discount that calculates the discount amount based on a purchase amount and a discount percentage.
If the purchase amount is greater than $100 and the discount percentage is 10% or more, the discount should be applied; otherwise, no discount is applied.
9. Create a Python program that calculates the ticket price for a zoo based on a visitor's age and category. The pricing rules are as follows:
For children (ages 3 to 12), the ticket price is $10.
For adults (ages 13 to 64), the ticket price is $20.
For seniors (ages 65 and above), the ticket price is $15.
Additionally, there's a discount of 10% for children and seniors on Sundays.
10. Create a Python program that calculates discounts based on the total purchase amount. The discount rules are as follows:
If the total purchase amount is $100 or more, provide a 10% discount.
If the total purchase amount is less than $100 but at least $50, provide a 5% discount.
If the total purchase amount is less than $50, no discount is applied.

11. What will be the output of
hours = input("enter hours: ")
rateperhr = 10
print("Your total rate is", int(hours)*rateperhr)
if the input will be “12”, what will be the output? If the error is there, what is the error? Explain all the things.
12. What will be the output of
a = input("enter a number: ")
b = input("enter another number: ")
if a>b:
 print("First number is the largest")
else:
 print("Second number is the largest")
Explain. If a<b logic is there what will be the output? If we will give 2.3331 as a and 2.3335 as b, then what will be the output? If we give “2.3335” and “2.3331” then what will be the output? If any error is there in any case then explain the error.
13. What will be the output of
x = 3
if x == 4:
  print("Yes")
else:
  print("No")
If the input will be x=”4”, what will be the output? If any error is there then explain.
14. Create a Python program that calculates the sum of a series based on user input. The series to be summed is of the form 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 - 6 + ... up to n terms.
